          Coding: Become a Successful Programmer without any IT background 2022
          <br /><br />
          Can you learn Coding without any IT background? The Answer is YES. It
          is possible to learn to program with whatever educational experience
          you have. Furthermore, the probability of using a programming language
          in this modern time would be higher than before. If you are already
          interested in programming languages, this is the best time to start
          learning them for your future career. This article will share some
          successful tips on studying programming language and managing to
          master it. Let’s get into it!
          <br />
        </p>
        <h2>1. Why do You want to Learn Programming?</h2>
        <img id="Blog_img_Language" src="./assets/images/5.png" alt="" height="527" />
        <h4>
          <li>Internet & Computer Basics</li>
          <li>
            Basic knowldege about coding , what is coding and the most important
            constant love about coding
          </li>
        </h4>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8rem">
          The first tip to any people who want to study Coding is to decide why
          they want to learn a Programming language. Is it for their career, for
          the knowledge, or do you want to follow the hype? I saw many friends
          and students who want to learn a programming language, but there are
          no solid reasons for their careers. They want to learn programming as
          of the trend that AI is the future, or many jobs need a programming
          language, but they don’t know what to do from learning or even about
          the job. In the first week, many are focused on learning everything
          they can — like, everything. They want to gain all the knowledge as
          soon as possible to apply for the job, but the motivation is a bit
          fragile. After the first week, many stopped their learning because
          They felt it was too hard or didn’t know what to do, or felt lost. It
          is essential for us who are not forced to learn the programming
          language during our education time or within our employees to build a
          strong base for understanding it. It was easy to mentally deny new
          things because we love to stick to our old habits — even the Research
          said so. Like the Research above, I had also felt to give up when
          learning a programming language for the first month. The motivation
          that I built helped me from quitting my learning as I have set a goal
          for my future. I know that programming language is essential in the
          modern world, and I know that a data science career is what I want. In
          short, try to build a strong reason for what and why you want to learn
          to program, and This will only help you in keep going
        </p>
        <h2>2. Decide Which Programming Language To Learn</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8rem; color: #000000">
          Let's know this from <br />
        </p>
        <img id="Blog_img_Language" src="./assets/images/1-1.png" alt=""  />
        <p style="line-height: 1.8rem; color: #000000" class="word-light">
          There is always a question about whether to start with Python or R for
          learning Programming Language as a beginner for Data Science. It does
          not matter from which language you start; you must go with the market
          demand or what the industry requires.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8rem; color: #000000">
          The important thing is to Research the job position, the industry, and
          the skillset you want first. For most Non-IT individuals, you might
          know which sector you want to join, but You won’t have experience in
          the job position. When you research the industry, they would demand a
          different skill set most of the time.
          <br />
          <br />
          As per my advice, you must decide which programming language to learn
          as per the industry demand. Do not try to juggle and try to know all
          the programming languages as it will lead to failure in the end
        </p>
        <h2>3. Always Start with the Fundamental</h2>
        <img id="Blog_img_Language" src="./assets/images/Fundamental-Analysis.png" alt="" height="527"/>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8rem; color: #000000">
          We should start with the fundamentals, but many people begin directly
          with something advanced. <br />
          <br />
          Many of my friends and students are not from an IT background and had
          started their learning directly by using the intermediate to advanced
          material. There is no way they understand it from the beginning,
          especially when we are not trained to use all these tools. They feel
          things are too complex and give up on learning any programming
          language. When you direct jump into the advanced things, your mind
          will not be ready for it and start to block the possibility of
          succeeding in learning any programming. There was a time when I
          started learning using advanced study materials, and I was also under
          the urge to quit my learning; then, I just thought of learning the
          Basic Fundamentals first. Then things started going much better. I
          built confidence in programming and had a great pace in learning and
          understanding advanced concepts.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8rem; color: #000000">
          <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Personal tip</span> —
          start from the fundamentals, and don’t get scared by the advanced
          material because you have to build up your skill from the bottom.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Use a Learning Outline or Guide</h2>
        <img id="Blog_img_Language" src="./assets/images/4.png" alt="" height="300" />
        <p style="line-height: 1.8rem; color: #000000">
          This is an important thing that everyone must do when learning to
          program. Many of them don’t use an outline while learning, making it
          difficult to find out where to start and learn. I used an online
          learning platform as my starting guide when I started learning Python.
          It is beneficial that I am a beginner in the programming language and
          need a map to begin studying. As a beginner, everyone should find a
          guide online that will help get an overview of the programming
          language and help you learn better.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Don’t Rush Things</h2>
        <img id="Blog_img_Language" src="./assets/images/Are-you-Ready-2-1-730x380.png" alt="" height="527" />
        <p style="line-height: 1.8rem; color: #000000b6">
          The important thing about learning is understanding the concept and
          applying it in various conditions. Maybe you feel jealous of all the
          people in some job or have excellent knowledge or with someone who
          already won many competitions — but you shouldn’t; everyone has their
          journey and pace. Learning a programming language is the same as
          learning a new language, but it takes time to apply it to various
          coding scenarios. If you feel your learning any programming language
          is a bit slow, don’t worry, it’s normal — it is your pace, don’t rush
          it. By rushing, you haven’t understood your fundamental learning. You
          want to start exploring the data, or when you are going applying for a
          job position and do not master the coding skill, This could hurt you
          mentally because you feel you are ready but fail. Learning will take
          time, especially for people who come from the non-IT; programming
          language takes time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my own experience,
          <span style="background-color: rgba(120, 59, 252, 0.324)"
            >my HTML and CSS learning journey takes around six months.</span
          >
          Yes, it takes me half a year to understand the fundamentals and apply
          them to any project. I know many people can understand faster than I
          do, so don’t feel left out and learn in your time and secure the goal
          you made.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold">My Tip</span> —
          Take your full time to learn the programming language and at your own
          pace to understand the concept properly
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style="color: grey; font-weight: bold;">Cybersecurity</span> is a term that refers to all processes, technologies,
          and individuals that collectively protect organizations from digital
          attacks. <span style="color: grey; font-weight: bold;">Cybersecurity professionals</span> use to install and manage
          sophisticated security software and search for vulnerabilities within
          an organization’s digital systems and create protocols to safeguard
          the companies, consumers, and information from malicious attackers.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span style="color: grey; font-weight: bold;">Cybersecurity teams </span> constantly strive to secure networks, proprietary
          applications, and systems against online threats and will be creating
          layers of protection across networks, computers, and sensitive data.
          As attackers become ever more innovative, these information security
          professionals fall to prevent malicious attackers from accessing,
          modifying, or destroying sensitive data.
          <br />
          <br />
          With so much of daily interactions being committed online, the work
          cybersecurity professionals do crucial, especially given the threat
          attackers pose to businesses today. Even a single data breach can
          result in massive financial loss if malicious attackers choose to
          steal or reveal corporate information, customer personal data, bank
          information, or other critical business intelligence.
